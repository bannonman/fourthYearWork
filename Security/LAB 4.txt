PART 1-Done (Email)

PART 2-TOR
	Use
	Tor is used for anonymous web browsing, it can also be 
	used for accessing the deep web. The use Tor, you must 
	download the browser. The browser then connects to the 
	Tor network, because all of your data goes through 
	relays the response time is very slow. Tor is the 
	easiest way to stay anonymous, when browsing the web 
	or hacking.

	Danger
	A danger of using tor as your main browser is that if 
	you access your Gmail, Google will stop your email 
	account from receiving and sending email. Some smarter
	networks can detect that your IP is from the Tor network 
	and they can ban you if they choose to.

PART 3- System Clock Attacks
	There are three main types of clock attacks including, 
	setting the clock back, stopping the clock and setting
	the clock forward.

	Setting The Clock Back
	By setting the clock back, a user can trigger a automated 
	program to repeat itself. An example of this, if a company 
	has automated program to pay its employees at a specific 
	time during the week or month, an attacker can set the time
	back to before the time that the payments are issued. 
	The attacker can then repeat the process until the companyâ€™s
	bank account is empty.  

	Stopping The Clock
	If the clock is stopped, programs that rely on time will 
	start to behave unpredictably. A GUI program that has to
	refresh every few seconds to display data will stop working
	and the wrong data will be displayed to the user.

	Setting The Clock Forward
	If a clock is set in the future, there can be a drastic effect.
	An example of this is, if a company has a system that relies
	on time to bill people. If the time on this system is set in the 
	future by a few months, the users can be billed for months of usage. 
	If the users have a direct debit with the billing company they can
	lose all of there money.
