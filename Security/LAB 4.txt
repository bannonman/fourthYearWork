PART 2-TOR 
	Use
	Tor is used for annonmous web browsing, it can also be used for accessing 
	the deep web. 

	Danger
	A danger of using tor as your main browser is that if you access your gmail, 
	google will stop your email account from recieving and sending email.

PART 3-Clock
	There are three main types of clock attachs including, setting the clock back,
	stopping the clock and setting the clock forward. 
	
	Setting The Clock Back
	By setting the clock back, a user can trigger a automated program to repeat itself.
	An example of this, if a company has automated program to pay its employees at 
	a specific time during the week or month, an attacker can set the time back to before 
	the time that the payments are issued. The atacker can then repeat the process until 
	the companies bank account is empty.   

	Stopping The Clock
	If the clock is stopped, programs that rely on time will start to behave unpredictably. 
	A Gui program that has to refresh every few seconds to display data will stop working 
	and the wrong data will be displayed to the user. 
	
	Setting The Clock Forward
	If a clock is set in the future, there can be a drastic effect. An example of this is, 
	if a company has a system that relies on time to bill people. If the time on this system 
	is set in the future by a few months, the users can be billed for months of usage. If the 
	users have a direct debit with the billing company they can lose all of there money.
